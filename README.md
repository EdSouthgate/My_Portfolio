# My_Portfolio
My first github repository and my first website designed from scratch.

12th June 2016 -
    Began work on the site. Making the website responsive without
    using bootstrap seems like it will be a real headache. Tried making a grid using
    calc() and percentages but so far it's just not working.

    To me it seems important to understand why it's easier to use a grid system
    before I start using them. I also feel that I need to work on naming classes as
    some of them are too specific and it might become a pain later on but I guess
    this is all a learning curve.
